# Evaluation of different Machine Learning Algorithms for Music Genre Classification


Supervised and Unsupervised Classification Algorithms have been used to Evaluate the Accuracy of Classification of a song to a Genre:

Procedure followed for preparing the Trains and Test datasets.

Step1: Convert the dataset in MP3 to WAV format.

Step2: Label the train and test dataset with the respective Genre.

Step3: Extract the features of the train and test dataset using MFCC feature extraction algorithm.

Step4: Store the extracted features as a Pickle file.

Step5: Use various Machine Learning Algorithms to compare the Accuracy of Classification.
